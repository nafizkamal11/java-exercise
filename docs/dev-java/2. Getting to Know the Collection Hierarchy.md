## **Avoiding Getting Lost in the Collection Hierarchy**

![](https://dev.java/assets/images/collections-framework/01_interfaces-hierarchy.png)

## **The Iterable Interface**

`Iterable` 

- not part of the Collections Framework
- but super interface of `Collection`
- object that implements `Iterable` is an object that you can iterate over.
- added in Java SE 5 (2004) along with the ***for each*** pattern of code.
- can iterate over any collection using this pattern, or any array.

    ```java
    Collection<String> collection = ...;
    
    for (String element: collection) {
        // do someting with element
    }
    ```

- To implement the `Iterable` interface need to provide an instance of another interface, `Iterator`

## **Storing Elements in a Container with the Collection Interface**

`Collection`  ← `List` `Set` 

`Collection`

- add or remove elements;
- test for the presence of a given element;
- ask for the number of elements contained, or if this collection is empty;
- clear this content.
- set operations
    - testing for the inclusion of a set in another set;
    - union;
    - intersection;
    - complement.
- ways of accessing its elements:
    - can iterate over the elements of a collection, through the use of an iterator;
    - can create a stream on these elements, that can be parallel.

## **Extending Collection with List**

`List` vs  `Collection` 

1. `List` remembers in what order its elements have been added.

    do not have this guarantee with a plain `Collection` nor for a `Set`

2. the elements of a list have an index.
    - Querying a collection for its *first* element does not make sense.

      Querying a list for its first element does make sense, since a list does remember that.

    - Get an element at a specific index, or delete it
    - Insert an element or replace an element at a specific position
    - Get a range of elements between two indexes.

## **Extending Collection with Set**

`Set` vs `Collection` 

- cannot have duplicates in a `Set` . so adding an element to a `Set` may fail.

    can have several instances of the same class that are equal in a `Collection`, or even the same instance more than once.


## **Sorting the element of a Set with SortedSet and NavigableSet**

    Set

        SortedSet

            NavigableSet

- `SortedSet`
    - maintains its elements sorted in the ascending order.
        - can get the lowest element, and the largest element of the set
        - can extract a `headSet` and a `tailSet` of all the elements lesser than, or greater than a given element.
    - To be able to sort them, a `SortedSet` needs to compare your elements.
        - elements may implement the `Comparable` interface, and provide a `compareTo()` method
        - give a `Comparator` to the `SortedSet` so that it can compare them.
    - What is the difference between sorting and ordering?
        - Sorting elements means that the first element you get while traversing a set will be the lowest one, in the sense of a given comparison logic.
        - Ordering elements means that the order in which you added them in a list is kept throughout the life of this list.

      So the first element you get while traversing a list is the first that has been added to it.

- `NavigableSet`
    - the possibility to iterate over the elements in the descending order.
    - does not change the behavior of a `SortedSet`.
