# 01. [Storing Data Using the Collections Framework](https://dev.java/learn/api/collections-framework/intro/)

## **Introducing the Collections Framework**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first introduced  | Java SE 2 | 1998  |
| rewritten  | Java SE 5  | when generics were added; |
| rewritten  | Java 8 | when lambda expressions were introduced,<br/>along with default methods in interfaces. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| purpose | Provides efficient ways to store, organize, and access in-memory data |
| structure | A set of interfaces modeling different ways to store data in containers |
| implementations | At least one implementation for each interface, choice depends on usage needs |
| updates | Almost every JDK version includes changes to the Collections Framework |

## **Finding Your Way in the Collections Framework**

- Two main categories:
  1. `Collection` ← `Iterable`
    - Collection: Stores objects and allows iteration (root interface: Collection)
  2. `Map`
    - Map: Stores key-value pairs (root interface: Map)
  - No direct relationship between Collection and Map
- A subcategory: `Queue` (modeled within Collection, supports FIFO/LIFO)
  - Queue/Stack: Part of Collection but focus on different behaviors
- A side category: `Iterator` (enables iteration over collections)
- Choosing an interface:
  - Iteration over objects
  - Queue operations (FIFO, LIFO)
  - Key-based retrieval
  - Index-based access
  - Sorting requirements
  - Avoiding duplicates/nulls
- Choosing an implementation:
  - Iteration vs. indexed access
  - Fixed vs. dynamic data storage
  - High-volume lookups
  - Concurrent access needs

## **Avoiding Using Old Interfaces and Implementations**


| Deprecated | Modern Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `Vector` | `ArrayList` |
| `Stack ← Vector` | `ArrayDeque` |
| `Enumeration` | `Iterator` |
| `HashTable` | `HashMap` (non-concurrent) / `ConcurrentHashMap` (concurrent) |

## **Why Choose a Collection Over an Array?**

- Arrays are simple and effective, but collections offer more functionality.
- **Advantages of collections over arrays:**
  - Track the number of elements dynamically.
  - No fixed capacity—can grow dynamically.
  - Control stored elements (e.g., prevent `null` values).
  - Query for element presence.
  - Provide operations like intersection and merging.
  - Collections are objects and can be extended, unlike arrays.
