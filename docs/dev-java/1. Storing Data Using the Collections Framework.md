# 01. [Storing Data Using the Collections Framework](https://dev.java/learn/api/collections-framework/intro/)

## **Introducing the Collections Framework**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first introduced  | Java SE 2 | 1998  |
| rewritten  | Java SE 5  | when generics were added; |
| rewritten  | Java 8 | when lambda expressions were introduced,<br/>along with default methods in interfaces. |

## **Finding Your Way in the Collections Framework**

- two main categories
  1. `Collection` ← `Iterable`
  2. `Map`
- a subcategory, `Queue`
- a side category, `Iterator`

## **Avoiding Using Old Interfaces and Implementations**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `Vector`  | `ArrayList` |
| `Stack ← Vector`  | `ArrayDeque`  |
| `Enumeration`  | `Iterator`  |
| `HashTable`  | `HashMap` `ConcurrentHashMap`  |

## **Why Choose a Collection Over an Array?**

- tracks the number of elements it contains
- capacity is not limited
- can control what elements may store in it. (can prevent null elements to be added)
- provides operations like intersecting or merging with another collection.
- a collection is an object and given that an object is extensible, can add any operation of the collections provided by the JDK.
  It is not possible to do this with an array, because an array is not an object in Java.
